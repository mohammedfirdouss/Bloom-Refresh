# Accessibility & Theming

## Accessibility
- Chakra UI provides accessible components by default.
- All forms use proper labels and error messages.
- Keyboard navigation is supported throughout.
- Color contrast is checked for all themes.

## Theming
- Light/dark mode toggle is available in the header.
- Theme is persisted per user (if logged in).
- Accent colors and high-contrast mode can be added via Chakra's theme extension.

## Why This Approach?
Accessibility is a must for modern web apps. Chakra UI and good practices ensure the app is usable by everyone, and theming improves user experience and inclusivity.
